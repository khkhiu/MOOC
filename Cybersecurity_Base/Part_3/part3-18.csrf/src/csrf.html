<!--
The exercise contains an unsafe bank application that uses GET methods without any CSRF protection.

The application has the following username and password combinations for testing:

    alice:redqueen
    bob:squarepants

Write an HTML file that when opened (if the user is logged in) moves $10 to Alice's account. Note that there is a confirmation dialog which you also need to deal with.

Do not use Javascript, instead use img tags.

The automated test will ignore the DNS name of the server in img tags, so you can use localhost:8000 freely, or any other name, depending on your setup.

Dear Sir.<br/>

I would like you to present you with this great opportunity.
