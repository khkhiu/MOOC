/* TO DO
 *Create the class Debt that has double-typed instance variables of balance and interestRate. 
 *The balance and the interest rate are passed to the constructor as parameters public Debt(double initialBalance, double initialInterestRate).
 *In addition, create the methods public void printBalance() and public void waitOneYear() for the class.
 *The method printBalance prints the current balance, and the waitOneYear method grows the debt amount.
 *The debt is increased by multiplying the balance by the interest rate.
