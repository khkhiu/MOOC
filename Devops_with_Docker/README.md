# [DevOps With Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/)
Repository for University of Helsinki's DevOps with Docker MOOC. This course provides an introduction to container technologies, with a particular focus on Docker and container orchestration using Docker Compose. Containers are a lightweight, portable way to package and deploy software applications. Throughout the course, we'll explore the various components of web services, such as reverse proxies and databases, and how they can be deployed using Docker.

## [Part 1](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/)
This part introduces containerization with Docker and relevant concepts such as image and volume. By the end of this part you are able to:

- Run containerized applications

- Containerize applications

- Utilize volumes to store data persistently outside of the containers.

- Use port mapping to enable access via TCP to containerized applications

- Share your own containers publicly

## [Part 2](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-2/)
This part introduces container orchestration with Docker Compose and relevant concepts such as docker network. By the end of this part you are able to:

- Run a group of containerized applications that interact with each other via HTTP

- Run a group of containerized applications that interact with each other via volumes

- Manually scale applications

- Use 3rd party services, such as databases, inside containers as part of your project

## [Part 3](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-3/)
This part introduces production-ready practices such as container optimization and deployment pipelines. We'll also familiarize ourselves with other container orchestration solutions. By the end of this part you are able to:

- Critically examine the images that you pull

- Trim the container size and image build time via multiple methods such as multi-stage builds.

- Automatically deploy containers
