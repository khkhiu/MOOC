Try-Catch challenge

Implement exception handling to satisfy the following challenge parameters:

    Start with the following application code:
    C# 

try
{
    Process1();
}
catch
{
    Console.WriteLine("An exception has occurred");
}

Console.WriteLine("Exit program");

static void Process1()
{
    WriteMessage();
}

static void WriteMessage()
{
    double float1 = 3000.0;
    double float2 = 0.0;
    int number1 = 3000;
    int number2 = 0;

    Console.WriteLine(float1 / float2);
    Console.WriteLine(number1 / number2);
}

Update the Process1 method to catch the exception that's thrown in the WriteMessage method.

The Process1 method should print the following message to console when the exception is caught:
Output

Exception caught in Process1

Don't change any code outside the Process1 method.

When you run your updated application, it should generate the following output:
Output

âˆž
Exception caught in Process1
Exit program

For the purposes of this challenge, you can ignore the output messages created by the debugger. For example, you can ignore the following messages:
Output

    Exception thrown: 'System.DivideByZeroException' in Exceptions101.dll

    The program '[436] Exceptions101.dll' has exited with code 0 (0x0).
