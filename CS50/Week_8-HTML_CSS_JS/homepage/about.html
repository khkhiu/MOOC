                    <p>
                        CS50 is Harvard University's introductory course on computer science and programming. It emphasizes the development of problem-solving skills, prioritizing correctness, design, and style. The course covers topics such as computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science in general. Its problem sets draw inspiration from various fields, including the arts, humanities, and sciences.

                        This course teaches fundamental programming principles, enabling students to learn new languages independently. The course starts with the C language, a traditional but essential language that underlies newer languages. Topics include not only variables, functions, conditionals, and loops, but also how computers work, like memory management. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that students will understand better because of their knowledge of C.

                        Towards the end of the course, the course introduces SQL, which students can use to store data in databases, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which students can use to create both web and mobile applications. The course culminates in a final project, where students put all the have learnt into practice.
