Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Predictions using 10 and 100 simulation appears to be inaccurate as both give vastly different results compared
to other simulation numbers.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
Based on simulation results, it appears that the program requires atleast 1000 simulations for it
to be accurate.
